# Credit Risk Analytics Toolkit

**Mission:** Internal tool for Nova Credit's Solutions Engineering team to generate "Retro-Risk Reports" for enterprise prospects, quantifying the value of Cash Atlasâ„¢ underwriting model on prospect data.

## Overview
This CLI tool processes a prospect's historical portfolio of declined loans (CSV) and generates a professional PDF report highlighting revenue opportunities and customer segments they're missing. It replaces costly validation studies with fast, data-backed analysis.

## Security & Data Handling

### Architecture
- **CLI-based:** No web server, no open ports, no public attack surface
- **Stateless:** Processes data in-memory, no persistent datastores
- **Local processing:** Runs on credentialed Solutions Engineer's corporate device

### Data Workflow
1. **Ingestion:** Prospect uploads anonymized CSV to segregated SFTP folder
2. **Processing:** Solutions Engineer downloads and processes locally
3. **Purge:** Input file deleted within 24 hours of report generation
